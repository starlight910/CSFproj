HOW TO PR:
- `git pull` to make sure dev branch is in sync.
- `git checkout -b juno/<assignment_number>` creates a new branch and switches to it
- Do your work
- Add/Commit your work as usual
- When ready to push, do `git push -u origin <branch_name>`
- Go to github.com and look at the branch you just pushed.
- Submit with a pull request into dev branch.
- Write some notes about the work you did and assign it to me.
- Once assigned to me, I will review/grade.
- If you want to go back to develop branch, `git checkout dev`
